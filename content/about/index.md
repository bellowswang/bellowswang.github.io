# About Me
<p><em>
  👋 This is Yihong (aka Bellows Ξ王). I write here to share how I've built the <b>data and AI department of myself, by myself and for myself</b>, and I believe you can do the same.
  Apart from this blog, there is more about me:
</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left: 0;">
<li>🐦 I talk about data, AI, music, etc. on <a href="https://twitter.com/BellowsWang/">Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>🎥 I build AI bots to learn chords from my favorite music and sometimes play 90s to 10s Chinese unpopular songs on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCowD4lmDNNHvId7FH4kOyXw/">YouTube</a>.</li>
<li>📊 I work as a data scientist and you can connect me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yihong-wang-28645847/">LinkedIn</a>.</li>
<li>🎓 I did my PhD in human mobility research and my work can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NtLuILkAAAAJ&hl=en/">Google Scholar</a>.</li>
