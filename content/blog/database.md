To start building our personal DNA (Data and AI) department, it's a must to own our data. Nowadays, data are usually not owned by ourselves as the users, but by the tech giants as the service providers. It's the time to take our data back. The very first step is to create a self-use database.

### What is a database?

> "A database is an organised collection of data (also known as a data store) stored and accessed electronically through the use of a database management system. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters of cloud storage."

### Why a database? Not excel, not gsheets, not python pandas with csv, but a database?

Many people without technical background are comfortable with using excel or gsheet. There are two main drawbacks of them:
* The user interface is friendly but it also at the same time limits the performance when the data becomes huge. Imagine loading 10 million rows of data into your excel or gsheet.
* They have their own ecosystems, which means the I/O interface is closed in their ecosystem as well. For example, if you want to visualise the data from a database, since the interface is universal and open, you can visualise them with many different tools. On the other hand, if you want to visualise the data in an excel file or in a gsheet, your options are quite limited.

Python is popular nowadays. People might ask why they need to use a database while they have pandas in Python to help them store data.

### Types of database



### How to host a database by yourself

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

### How to ingest data into your database

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

### ### How to query from a database

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.
