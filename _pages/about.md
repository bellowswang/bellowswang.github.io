I am working on urban travel demand modeling using new big data sources, such as mobile phone traces and public transport smart card data. I have developed statistical learning models to explain and predict spatial-temporal behavior of travelers, which can inform urban authorities or mobility companies to make better decisions. My research concerns the following specific topics:
* Modeling location choice of flexible (non-work) activities
* Relating activity-travel behavior to mobile phone usage
* Finding latent factors behind anonymous travelers
