Recently, I have been working on the solutions to the [Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting) on the Kaggle. The challenge asked participants to predict how many future visitors a restaurant would receive. The data include both the number of visits and the number of reservations to hundreds of restaurants in Japan. This is very interesting to me not only because I like to improve my deep learning skill, but also because I like Japanese restaurants a lot! The figure above shows the time series of the number of visits to one of the restaurants.
