I am participating in the "Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting" challenge on the Kaggle.

This challenge asks the participants to predict how many future vistitors a restaurant will receive. The data record both the number of visits and the number of reservations to hundreds of restaurants in Japan. This is very interesting to me not only because I like to improve my deep learning skill, but also because I like Japanese restaurants a lot! The figure below shows the time series of the number of visits to one of the restaurants.
