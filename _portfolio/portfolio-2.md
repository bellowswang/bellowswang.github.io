title: "Road network design in a developing country using mobile phone data"
excerpt: "Is there any correlation between telecommunication and travel demand? This study used mobile phone traces to depict mobility patterns, and related inter-regional travel demand with inter-regional telecommunication intensity. Based on that, a trip distribution model was developed and embedded in a road network optimization algorithm. The method was applied to a case study for road network design in Senegal. It is valuable and reproducible not only to Senegal but also to other countries where traditional mobility data is scarce but mobile phone data is available.

The method consists of three parts:
* Extracting mobility patterns from mobile phone traces,
* Building an adapted formulation of the gravity-based trip distribution model, which considers telecommunication intensity (i.e., aggregate number of calls and text messages) and travel time as input to forecast the influence of road improvements on country-wide mobility, and
* Optimizing the road network investment based on the adapted trip distribution model by using a local search algorithm.

The method was applied to the case study country of Senegal. The mobile phone data was transformed to support decisions on road network development in that country given different objectives, including accessibility and equity.
